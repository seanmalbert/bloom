<h2 id="information-collect" className="my-5">1. WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>

##### Definitions

We require certain information to provide our Services to you. For example, you may be required to have an account in order to interact with certain aspects of the Services. When you choose to share the information below with us, we collect and use it to operate our Services. "Personal Data" means data that allows someone to identify or contact you, including, for example, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, travel preferences, specific expenses, as well as any other non-public information about you that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing data. "Anonymous Data" means data that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Data; Anonymous Data does not permit the identification of individual persons. As used in this document, the general term “information” includes all data provided by you or collected via the Services, including both Personal Data and Anonymous Data. We collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data, as described below.

##### Information You Provide.

When you use the Services, you will provide information that could be Personal Data, such (a) your name, email address, mobile telephone number, password for the Site, date of birth, tax identification number, schedule, picture, and other registration information; (b) information you provide us when you contact us for help; (c) any information required to ensure a User is eligible to participate in a specific program or aspect of Services; and (d) any other information you enter into the Services.

##### Information We Collect Automatically

We automatically receive and record information from your use of the Services, including but not limited to: Site usage, your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, clickstream data, and cookie information. Generally, the Services automatically collect usage information, such as the number and frequency of users of the Services. 

##### Cookies.

Cookies are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer while you are viewing the website. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer/mobile phone until you delete them) to provide the Services, and to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Site.  We use cookies to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you use the Services. Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. You will not be able to take advantage of the most attractive features of the Services if you disable your cookies.

##### Pixel Tags.

Pixel Tags (also referred to as clear Gifs, Web beacons, or Web bugs). Pixel Tags are tiny graphic images with a unique identifier, similar in function to Cookies, that are used to track online movements of Web users. In contrast to Cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, Pixel Tags are embedded invisibly in Web pages. Pixel Tags also allow us to send e-mail messages in a format users can read, and they tell us whether e-mails have been opened to ensure that we are sending only messages that are of interest to our users. The use of a pixel allows us to record, for example, that a user has interacted with a message, visited a particular web page or clicked on a particular advertisement. We do not provide Personal Data to any advertising networks for use outside of the Services.

##### Analytics.

We use third party analytics services, including but not limited to Google Analytics ("Analytics Services"), to help analyze how users use our Site and Services. We use the information we get from Analytics Services only to improve our Site and Services. The information generated by the Cookies or other technologies about your use of our Site and Services (the "Analytics Information") is transmitted to the Analytics Services. The Analytics Services use Analytics Information to compile reports on user activity. The Analytics Services may also transfer the Analytics Information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process Analytics Information on their behalf. Each Analytics Service’s ability to use and share Analytics Information is restricted by such Analytics Service’s Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. By using our Site and Services, you consent to the processing of data about you by Analytics Services in the manner and for the purposes set out above. For a full list of Analytics Services, please contact us at ACHousingPortal@acgov.org.

##### Third Party Data.

We may receive and/or share Personal and/or Anonymous Data about you to companies that help us provide our Services by way of a co-branded or private-labeled website or companies that offer their products and/or services on our Services (e.g., housing developers and property managers). These third party companies may receive Personal Data and Anonymous Data. They will only use such data in compliance with our security and privacy standards set forth in this Privacy Policy.

We are always looking for ways to make our Services smarter, faster, more secure, integrated and useful to you. In addition, we intend to use the Aggregate Information (as described below) to positively influence housing policy. To that end, we use collective learnings about how people use our Services and feedback provided directly to us to troubleshoot and to identify trends, usage, activity patterns and areas for integration and improvement of the Services.

##### For safety and security.

We use information about you and your Service use to verify accounts and activity, to monitor suspicious or fraudulent activity and to identify violations of Service policies.

##### To protect the public interests and legal rights.

Where required by law, where we believe it is in the public interest, or where it is necessary to protect our legal rights, interests and the interests of others, we use information about you in connection with legal claims, compliance, regulatory, and audit functions.

<h2 id="share-information" className="my-5">3. HOW WE SHARE INFORMATION</h2>

We may share your information with our third-party service providers, including property managers and developers and staff from Alameda County cities and our Agents, to comply with legal obligations, to protect and defend our rights and property, ensure the functionality of the Site, or with your permission. Below are the specific ways we share information we collect about you.

##### User Profile Information.

User profile information including your name, email, phone number and other information you enter may be displayed to other users to facilitate user interaction within the Services (for example, to enable property managers to contact you about housing opportunities).

##### Information Shared with Our Agents.

We employ and contract with people and other entities that perform certain tasks on our behalf and who are under our control (our “Agents”), including companies to build and maintain the Site. We may need to share Personal Data with our Agents in order to provide products or services to you. Unless we tell you differently, our Agents do not have any right to use Personal Data or other information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. You hereby consent to our sharing of Personal Data with our Agents.

##### IP Address Information.

While we collect and store IP address information, that information is not made public. We do at times, however, share this information with our partners, service providers and other persons with whom we conduct business, and as otherwise specified in this Privacy Policy.

##### Aggregate Information.

We share Aggregate Information with our agents, partners, and service providers. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners can understand how and how often people use our Services and their services or websites, which facilitates improving both their services and how our Services interface with them. In addition, these third parties may share with us non-private, aggregated or otherwise non-Personal Data about you that they have independently developed or acquired.

##### Information Disclosed for Our Protection, the Protection of Others and Legal Requirements.

We also reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information as it reasonably believes is necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, (ii) enforce our Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, (iv) respond to user support requests, or (v) protect our rights, property or safety, our users and the public. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and spam/malware prevention.

##### Information We Share with Your Consent:

We will share your Personal Data with any relevant party you have granted us permission to share with.

<h2 id="store-information" className="my-5">4. HOW WE STORE AND SECURE INFORMATION</h2>

Keeping your information secure is a top priority for us. To that end we comply with industry-standard best practices to secure your information. We use data hosting service providers in the United States to host the information we collect, and we use technical measures to secure your data. While we implement safeguards designed to protect your information, no security system is impenetrable and due to the inherent nature of the internet, we cannot guarantee that data, during transmission through the internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, is absolutely safe from intrusion by others. How long we keep information we collect about you depends on the type of information, as described in further detail below. After such time, we will either delete or anonymize your information or, if this is not possible (for example, because the information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your information and isolate it from any further use until deletion is possible.

##### Account Information.

We retain your Personal Data only as long as necessary to accomplish the purpose for which it was collected or to comply with our legal and contractual obligations, plus 1 year, and then securely dispose of that information. We also retain some of your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements, to support operations and to continue to develop and improve our Services. Where we retain information for Service improvement and development, we take steps to eliminate information that directly identifies you, and we only use the information to uncover collective insights about the use of our Services, not to specifically analyze personal characteristics about you.

##### Information You Share on the Services

If your account is deactivated or disabled, some of your Personal Data and Anonymous Data and the content you have provided will remain.

##### Marketing information

If you have elected to receive marketing emails from us, we retain information about your marketing preferences unless you specifically ask us to delete such information. We retain information derived from cookies and other tracking technologies for a reasonable period of time from the date such information was created.

##### Property Managers and Developers.

If you are a property manager or developer using the Services and gain access to another user’s Personal Data, you agree to store and secure that Personal Data in compliance with the standards set forth in this Privacy Policy.  

<h2 id="access-information" className="my-5">5. HOW TO ACCESS AND CONTROL YOUR INFORMATION</h2>

You can stop all further collection of information by discontinuing use of the Service.

<h2 id="additional" className="my-5">6. ADDITIONAL IMPORTANT PRIVACY MATTERS</h2>

##### Minimum Age.

The Services are not directed to individuals under 18. We do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under 18. If we become aware that a child under 18 has provided us with Personal Data, we will take steps to delete such information. If you become aware that a child has provided us with Personal Data, please contact our support services.

##### Security:

We are concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your Personal Data. We provide physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect information we process and maintain and use a combination of firewall barriers, encryption techniques and authentication procedures. For example, we limit access to your Personal Data to authorized employees and contractors who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our Services. Please be aware that, although we endeavor to provide reasonable security for information we process and maintain, no security system can prevent all potential security breaches.

##### Links to Other Sites.

Our Service may contain links to other sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the privacy policy of every site you visit. We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third-party sites or services.

##### Changes to this Privacy Policy.

We will notify you when we change this Privacy Policy. We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make significant changes in the way we treat your Personal Data, or to the Privacy Policy, we will provide notice to you on the Services or by some other means, such as email. Please review the changes carefully. If you agree to the changes, simply continue to use our Services.  Your continued use of our Services after the revised Privacy Policy has become effective indicates that you have read, understood, and agreed to the current version of this Policy.  If you object to any of the changes to our terms and you no longer wish to use our Services, you may close your account(s). Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Policy applies to all information that we have about you and your account.
