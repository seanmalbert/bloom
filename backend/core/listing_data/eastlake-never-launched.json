Additionally, EBALDC will verify past tenant history of the applicant household within its own portfolio. Absence of prior rental history will not automatically disqualify an otherwise eligible applicant. EBALDC, however, may request alternative means of verifying prior residence or lack of residence, as well as request provision of personal references. Applicants may be denied due to 1) A negative unlawful detainer report indicating failure to meet financial obligations in past tenant history, or a recent eviction within the past 5 years, and 2) A negative landlord recommendation, encompassing failure to comply with the lease; poor payment history; failure to maintain the unit in a healthy, safe, and sanitary condition; crimes of violence to persons; destruction or theft of property; sales of narcotics; eviction for cause or other criminal acts which would adversely affect the health, safety, or welfare of other tenants.",
